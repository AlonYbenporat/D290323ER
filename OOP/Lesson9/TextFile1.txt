Project Title: Library Management System
Project Overview:
Design and implement a console-based Library Management System using C# and .NET. 
This application will manage a library's book inventory, track book loans to members, 
and handle returns. This project will demonstrate an understanding of C# basics, 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, 
and encapsulation, without requiring generics or more advanced features.

Key Features:

Book Inventory Management:

Add, update, or remove books from the inventory.
View a list of all books, including details like book ID, title, author, and availability status.
Membership Management:

Register new library members.
Update or remove existing members.
View a list of all members.
Loan Management:

Check out books to members (mark books as loaned and record to whom they are loaned).
Accept returned books (update their availability status).
View a list of all currently loaned books, including loanee details.
Search Functionality:

Search for books by title, author, or ID.
Search for members by name or ID.
Data Persistence: (Optional Advanced Feature)

Save and load library data to and from a file.
Suggested Classes and Objects:

Book: Represents a book with properties like ID, title, author, and availability status.
Member: Represents a library member with properties like ID, name, and contact information.
Inventory: Manages the collection of books, including add, update, and remove operations.
MemberRegistry: Manages member registrations and updates.
LoanManager: Handles the checking out and returning of books.
Search: Provides methods to search books and members.
Additional Considerations:

UI/Menu: Implement a simple text-based menu system for navigating the application's features.
Error Handling: Include basic error handling to manage user input and prevent the application
from crashing due to invalid data. Comments and Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation 
for your classes and methods to describe their functionality.
